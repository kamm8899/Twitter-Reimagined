Remember when America truly was great? Remember when the slightest objection to the lamestream media's self-imposed status quo didn't result in your social media accounts being cancelled by the liberal elite and Big Internet? Look no further, my friends, for you are in the company of confederates. Welcome to OnlyBans, the last refuge of freedom.

## What is OnlyBans?

OnlyBans is a message board that allows a user to sign up, log in, and delete their posts. Although every member of OnlyBans is able to view messages across the site, only a user can delete their own. We don't believe in censorship here, and every opinion is valid.

## Technologies

OnlyBans was designed with the following stack:
* React
* MaterialUI
* MongoDb
